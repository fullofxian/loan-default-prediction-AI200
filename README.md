# loan-default-prediction-AI200

This is a scenario-based predictive classification capstone project on loan default rates for the LendingClub, a company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 

When the company receives a loan application, they must make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: the risk of approving a loan to someone who will default and the risk of not approving a loan to someone who would repay it.

### The aim of this project is to identify patterns indicating if a person is likely to default on a loan based on characteristics of that applicant and historical data. 
By identifying risky loan applicants, LendingClub aims to reduce credit loss and minimize financial loss caused by defaulting borrowers.

- This project is modeled after the LendingClub Issued Loans dataset, which contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted. **Solving this case study will provide insights into real-world risk analytics in banking and financial services, demonstrating how data can be used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.**
- This was submitted as part of an internal kaggle competition to culminate all the various machine learning techniques to be applied.

## Usage

To run the project, open the `notebooks/AI200_Capstone_SX_Revised.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. The datasets used in the analysis can be found in the `data` directory.

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project is the LendingClub Issued Loans dataset, obtained from LendingClub, a US peer-to-peer lending company headquartered in San Francisco, California. It contains information about loan applicants, including their profiles, loan status, and repayment history.

- `lc_trainingset.csv`: Contains 316,824 loan applications labeled with loan statuses (charged off/fully paid).
- `lc_testset.csv`: Contains 78,237 unseen loan applications unlabeled for submission purposes.
  
## Additional Notes

`notebooks/AI200_Capstone_SX_Revised.ipynb` is different from the original notebook that was used to submit for the competition `Team_8_Project_Final.ipynb`. After the project's completion, I continued to work on the project for self-learning purposes and explore if the model's performance could be improved. As a result, the notebook reflects additional analysis and modifications made post-competition in an attempt to achieve a higher score (0.9067 team & 0.9136 revised).

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to LendingClub for providing the dataset used in this project. Also to my groupmates for working together on the assignment, providing plenty of fresh perspectives and learning pointers.
